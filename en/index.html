<h2>Thirty Principles of Networkism</h2>
<p><b>1 - Humanity is a living network</b></p>
<p>2 - Nodes of living networks follow stable, robust, and simple behavioral patterns when processing signals, which we call <i>invariants</i>. For example, a living neuron always fires whenever it receives a certain load, despite usual chemical variations.</p>
<p>3 - Living networks ensure that their nodes comply with their invariants through activity promotion and discouragement mechanisms, also known as alignment mechanisms.</p>
<p>4 - Humanity is simpler than other living networks like the brain, cells, or ecosystems, because it has fewer nodes and connections.</p>
<p>5 - Invariants have the strength and robustness of life. Plants can break through cement to keep growing. Issues that emerge from the network invariants can only be solved with remedies woven in the network's structure.</p>
<p>6 - Humans are more intuitive than rational. Intuition processes information <i>from</i> the human network, and <i>through</i> the human network.</p>
<p>7 - Emotions are people's invariants. Each emotion perceives and emits promotion and discouragement signals to regulate how, when, and why we work together.</p>
<p>8 - Emotions sufficiently align incentives in small scales, but not in large and highly connected groups.</p>
<p>9 - Emotions generate discomfort when they do not align our incentives. Anxiety or depression epidemics, cronic stress, and the increase in social violence are natural reactions of robust invariants to distortions in the human network.</p>
<p>10 - Leadership is an alignment mechanism that works on larger scales than emotions. It works when one person manages penalties and rewards within a community. Leadership structures may consist of many levels and generate hierarchies.</p>
<p>11 - Leadership is a stable form of power and it is the general form of economic hierarchies. It allows leaders to obtain extraordinary gains and it is the main component of economic inequality.</p>
<p>12 - Some technological developments allow for the growth of productive groups. When led groups grow, their hierarchies grow, and inequality increases.</p>
<p>13 - Growing hierarchies take followers from other hierarchies. Losing hierarchies eventually die. Sometimes, smaller hierarchies restrict the freedom of their followers to avoid losing them. Eventually, larger hierarchies release followers from smaller hierarchies to continue growing.</p>
<p>14 - When an entire society lives under a single hierarchy, the leader's margin of profit is maximized, the standard of living of others is minimized, and the social system tends towards despotism or collapses.</p>
<p>15 - Debating and raising awareness is futile for social change. The human network obeys promotion and discouragement signals. Discourse and moral values are effects of social action rather than its causes. Changing the world requires changing the network.</p>
<p>16 - Predominant ethical and political positions focus on individuals and discourse, but humanity is a network.</p>
<p>17 - We pay attention to infrequent or surprising phenomena and tend to ignore what is always there. This paradox of attention hid the laws that regulate social action and diverted ethical and political thought towards insignificant topics like discourse, rational decisions, and ethical dilemmas.</p>
<p>18 - There are genuine problems and pseudo-problems. Pseudo-problems are problems that cannot be resolved until a genuine problem is resolved, and once the genuine problem is resolved, they are automatically resolved. Most predominant efforts to resolve environmental, emotional, and economic catastrophes work on pseudo-problems. Genuine crises are few and are found and resolved in the network.</p>
<p>19 - Points of view are technologies. Changing paradigms simplifies what used to be complex.</p>
<p>20 - Humanity has been modeled from three paradigms: dualism, born in the 18th century to model planetary orbits, gasism, born in the 19th century to model ideal gases, and networkism, born with computation and serving to understand networks of multiple nodes that interact, adapt, and can form structures. Dualistic and gasistic paradigms fail because they are not suitable for understanding humanity.</p>
<p>21 - Modern thought failed to comprehend and transform humanity scientifically because it did not have enough tools to understand living networks. Postmodern thought abandoned the pretension of scientifically understanding and transforming reality. The networkist paradigm allows studying humanity and social transformation scientifically.</p>
<p>22 - Western philosophy distinguished two separate ways of knowing the world: reason and intuition, <i>diánoia</i> and <i>noesis</i>, <i>ratio</i> and <i>intuitio</i>, or system 2 and system 1. Reason processes information in series and captures few things at once, but it is communicable and perfectible, allowing science to be done. Intuition processes information in parallel and allows capturing networks, but it is not communicable nor perfectible, so it does not allow science to be done. Computation allows capturing and understanding networks, and it is communicable and allows science to be done, closing a knowledge gap that lasted 100,000 years.</p>
<p>23 - Modern rational thought discarded intuitive or mystical ideas from antiquity because it did not understand them. Some of them described, in broad strokes and falteringly, deep properties of the human network.</p>
<p>24 - Points of view can be understood as functions that take an observed system and return a seen system. The formal study of points of view allows resolving crucial philosophical and metaphysical problems. In particular, it dissolves the dichotomy between absolute truths and truths as arbitrary constructions, because it defines precisely what it means for something to be true from a point of view.</p>
<p>25 - Each point of view sees a system with its own dynamics and gradient of movement. Predictions from simple models can contain errors, and these are perceived as perturbations or noise. From a point of view, the energy needed for a process to occur against the natural direction of the seen system is the sum of perturbations required for it to occur.</p>
<p>26 - Emotions and community dynamics are the noise of economic models. From an economic perspective, communities are a source of nuclear energy, as they seem to create energy out of nothing, energy that comes from another system.</p>
<p>27 - Living networks can be studied with a magnifying glass or from a lookout. A crisis-stricken forest where the swamp rots, toucans get sick, and insects devour what is left can be studied in two ways. The specialist approach looks at each issue with a magnifying glass and sees intricate, independent, complex, multicausal, and apparently irresolvable problems. From the lookout, one sees a single simple cause: deforestation.</p>
<p>28 - Simple problems of living networks often have simple solutions. A forest is a living network, and each of its organisms evolved to sustain balances in that network. When the network is distorted, balances are lost, and the system suffers crises, but life is robust. Repairing the network is enough for life to recover its balances and heal the forest.</p>
<p>29 - Crises of anxiety, depression, and stress, and the growth of social violence arise from specific distortions in the functioning of our communications. There are simple mechanisms that we can implement in a social network to heal the emotional crisis.</p>
<p>30 - The growth of inequality and poverty, the general tendency of economic systems towards despotism or collapse, and the tendency to destroy the environment arise from properties of leadership dynamics. There are simple mechanisms that we can implement in a productive network to save the world.</p>
