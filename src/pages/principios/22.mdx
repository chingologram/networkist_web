Western philosophy distinguished two separate ways of knowing the world: reason and intuition, <i>di√°noia</i> and <i>noesis</i>, <i>ratio</i> and <i>intuitio</i>, or system 2 and system 1. Reason processes information in series and captures few things at once, but it is communicable and perfectible, allowing science to be done. Intuition processes information in parallel and allows capturing networks, but it is not communicable nor perfectible, so it does not allow science to be done. Computation allows capturing and understanding networks, and it is communicable and allows science to be done, closing a knowledge gap that lasted 100,000 years.
