There are genuine problems and pseudo-problems. Pseudo-problems are problems that cannot be resolved until a genuine problem is resolved, and once the genuine problem is resolved, they are automatically resolved. Most predominant efforts to resolve environmental, emotional, and economic catastrophes work on pseudo-problems. Genuine crises are few and are found and resolved in the network.
