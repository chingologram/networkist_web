Simple problems of living networks often have simple solutions. A forest is a living network, and each of its organisms evolved to sustain balances in that network. When the network is distorted, balances are lost, and the system suffers crises, but life is robust. Repairing the network is enough for life to recover its balances and heal the forest.
