Humanity has been modeled from three paradigms: dualism, born in the 18th century to model planetary orbits, gasism, born in the 19th century to model ideal gases, and networkism, born with computation and serving to understand networks of multiple nodes that interact, adapt, and can form structures. Dualistic and gasistic paradigms fail because they are not suitable for understanding humanity.
